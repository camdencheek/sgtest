this is a big file
that contains a bunch of new lines
and we don't want to return all of them
we only want to return the ones that match `test`
like the line above this one
and the line below this one
because this line contains `test`
but this one doesn't
so there should only be a couple of context lines
surrounding the two lines that contain the searched term
and our diff payload should not include this line
and now I added a new line that contains `test`
